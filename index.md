Hello, my name is Matt.

### Background
I grew up in a suburb outside of LA (Agoura Hills) and now live in San Francisco. After high school, I attended the University of Michigan, where I obtained a BSE in Computer Science.

While studying at Michigan, I was involved with the [Solar Car Team](https://www.solarcar.engin.umich.edu), [Eta Kappa Nu](https://hkn.eecs.umich.edu), and TAing for [EECS 485 (Web Systems)](https://eecs485staff.github.io/eecs485.org).

### Experience
Currently, I'm a product software engineer working on the [Express Drive](https://www.lyft.com/expressdrive) team at Lyft. Previously, I've had internships on teams at Facebook (iOS), Google (Unified Notifications), and Etsy (Promoted Listings).

I have experience with:

* __languages__: python3, c++11, ES6, SQL
* __databases__: dynamodb, S3, elasticsearch, redis
* __technologies__: mypy, statsd, protobufs, envoy
* __tools__: git, zsh, neovim, tmux
